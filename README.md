# Advanced FEM Techniques 2021 - AFEMT21 

Lecturer: Andrea Cangiani

Course Type: PhD Course

Academic Year: 2020-2021

Period: May - June

Duration: 20 h

Description: 

This is an advanced monographic course on the numerical analysis of PDEs using state-of-the-art nonconforming and discontinuous finite element methods. This will include very recent research on the development of methods on extremely general meshes, such as virtual elements and discontinuous Galerkin methods. 

Topics:

    Nonconforming methods
    Discontinuous Galerkin methods
    A priori error analysis
    A posteriori error analysis and adaptivity
    Extensions to general meshes
